    <h1>TDX Expert Rundown And Tips</h1></header>
    <section><h2>TDX is a tower defense game on roblox, and I already know that you might be turn off at the word "Roblox", but TDX is very good for it being on Roblox. The only things bad about TDX are mostly anything that's dated; like, sadly the first two modes of the game. They are planned to be reworked in the coming months, but it will be a bit until they start. Now expert is currently the hardest normla mode; however very soon or even right as you read this, nightmare mode will take this spot and expert will be the second hardest normal mode. People do still tend to stuggle on this mode still, so I will hand down my knowledge of this mode so everyone can beat it :D.</h2></section>
    <section> <img src="../png/xsoldier.png" alt="orderinary"><article><p>I'll keep this from being a full walkthough of the mode as it's best to make your own strat to beat it then taking one, as at the end of the day TDX is a strategy game. I will still highly recommend to bring Railgunner, Juggernut, and Medic; as all three of them carry through the mode mid and late game. Now for the early game itself is pretty rough, not only flying enemies will show up at wave 11 and highly bullet resisted enemies showing up at wave 8, but the Xsoldier will make his first appearance at wave 6. Xsoldier doesn't have high health, fast speed, or even a high resist to a damge type; no instead he has a gun that he will use to start killing your towers. He doesn't do a lot damage, but he does enough, so if there hasn't been a lot of time for your attacked tower to regen it's health back, the next Xsoldier go finish it off.</p>
    <p>To deal with this rough early game medic would help a lot as you wouldn't have to place down bate towers to not waste so much money.  Another good solution is would be sentry for bate as it's very low cost and rebuild, letting it tank hits at a very cheep cost. Along with these this spawner would also be good, keep in mind though that Xsoldier can still kill spawner units and that you can only get away with this on easier maps. Also for early damage I haven't found a way to use lazer gunner for early that hasn't caused problems for mid game, but golden ranger works very well here with it's bottom path having good health, early dsp, damage type, and being able to hit hidden and flying enemies.</p></section>

    <section> <img src="../png/vx.png" alt="That Bird"> <p>VX drone is super hard, like nightmare hard. He will kill like one railgunner maybe, but then die and kill all of your towers. so for a rough translation. You shoulld never stuggle with VX drone unless you are on a hard map or didn't know to put down more flying detection towers.</p><p>If you have a few fly detection tower then he will die. Thankfully if you beat him you shouldn't have problems with flying enemies until the final boss you'll be good on fly detection, so it's a great time to work on dsp for the last two bosses in the mode.</p></section>
