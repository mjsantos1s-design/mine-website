    <h1>TDX Expert Rundown And Tips</h1></header>
    <section><h2>TDX is a tower defense game on roblox, and I already know that you might be turn off at the word "Roblox", but TDX is very good for it being on Roblox. The only things bad about TDX are mostly anything that's dated; like, sadly the first two modes of the game. They are planned to be reworked in the coming months, but it will be a bit until they start. Now expert is currently the second hardest standard mode; however very soon or even right as you read this, ultra mode will take the spot of nightmare mode, and then nightmare mode wil take expert's spot; so then, expert will be the thrid hardest standard mode. People do still tend to stuggle on this mode still, so I will hand down my knowledge of this mode so everyone can beat it :D.</h2></section>
    <section> <img src="../png/xsoldier.png" alt="orderinary"><article><p>I'll keep this from being a full walkthough of the mode as it's best to make your own strat to beat it then taking one, as at the end of the day TDX is a strategy game. I will still highly recommend to bring Railgunner, Juggernut, and Medic; as all three of them carry through the mode mid and late game. Now for the early game itself is pretty rough, not only flying enemies will show up at wave 11 and highly bullet resisted enemies showing up at wave 8, but the Xsoldier will make his first appearance at wave 6. Xsoldier doesn't have high health, fast speed, or even a high resist to a damge type; no instead he has a gun that he will use to start killing your towers. He doesn't do a lot damage, but he does enough, so if there hasn't been a lot of time for your attacked tower to regen it's health back, the next Xsoldier go finish it off.</p>
    <p>To deal with this rough early game medic would help a lot as you wouldn't have to place down bate towers to not waste so much money.  Another good solution is would be sentry for bate as it's very low cost and rebuild, letting it tank hits at a very cheep cost. Along with these this spawner would also be good, keep in mind though that Xsoldier can still kill spawner units and that you can only get away with this on easier maps. Also for early damage I haven't found a way to use lazer gunner for early that hasn't caused problems for mid game, but golden ranger works very well here with it's bottom path having good health, early dsp, damage type, and being able to hit hidden and flying enemies.</p></section>
    <section> <img src="../png/predators.png" alt="Roblox Drama"><p> The mid game is where things get interesting with expert, but not hard <b>YET</b>.</p><p>The notable enemies that show up here are Super Heavy Titans and Revived Monsters for being thick slow walls of eneimes; but also the Jumpers that is a speedy enemy that will make large jump over the path that makes him becomes invincible until he touches the ground along with it also letting him skip corners; Speed Doployers that will drop down a pad that will make anything that walks over it 70% faster for 10 seconds; Purgatorys that debuffs tower with it's damaging rockets that also have the ability to hit flying towers; and last, but not least Boundeds that will start slow, but have a 30 second timer on them and once it goes off they start running down the path, along with their tanky health if they aren't with probably, can easily reach the exit.</p>
    <p>It does sound, like a lot to deal with, but thankfully expert waves don't put too many enemies on a wave at once. So you will only have to deal with a couple of them at a time. Along with that their high health let you get lots of money so start placing down bigger stuff, like Juggernuts and Railgunners.</p>
    <p>Watch out though as in wave 29 two Predators, doing some what damage to towers and along with that they come out with a lot of other eneimes, as you can see in the image above. You shouldn't stuggle with this wave too much, but this is the last wave to get a lot of money and towers down for the wave 30, mini bosses.</p></section>
    <section> <img src="../png/threedudes.png" alt="That Bird That I hate">
        <figcaption id="gods"><b id="phoebus">Phoebus</b>---<b id="zeus">Zeus</b>---<b id="artemis">Artemis</b></figcaption>
        <p>Now when these three come out it might now look too bad, until everything you have it dead and you have no money to put anything else down.</p>
    <p>The god trio are either the hardest wave of expert, or second hard wave. Either way they are very hard to deal with. The first one that come out is Phoebus that start by charing through the start of the path with his sheild quickly. If not killed soon he can get out of hand very easily with his flamethrower attack, burning down multiple towers and easily killing them if not healed immediately; along with that he can gain extra sheild health that won't give you cash and will making it harder to finish him off.</p> 
    <p>The next one that comes out is Zeus that is easily the easiest one of the trio to deal with his low damage compare to the others. He tries to make up for this with being the stunner of the group, hitting multiple towers in his range at once with his stunning attacks. He can also hit air towers with most of his attacks, but he not the problem for air towers.</p>
    <p>Now the last, but 100% not least Artemis a flying enemy with super high damage attacks that can easily kill a max level Juggernut if not healed, along with having AoE attacks that do simlar damage in his second phase.</p> 
    <p>Now how do you dealing with them?</p> 
    <p>Now a lot can work here, but the set up that works for me is to get two top path Juggernuts and a few top path Railgunners. Once the wave starts the goal is to kill Phoebus before Artemis comes out. If Artemis does come out before your done have a back up plan ready to with Phoebus as next you want to switch the targeting for the Railgunners to last to try to kill Artemis as soon as possible, and unlike the other two Artemis doesn't have too much health. Once Artemis dies work on Phoebus and then Zeus, the only thing to mention is the fact that they all blow out and doing high damage to any towers near them when they die, so watch out for that.</p></section>
    <section> <img src="../png/vx.png" alt="That Bird"> 
        <figcaption id="VX"><b>VX Drone</b></figcaption>
    <p>After the god trio things don't get too hard with the wave leading to VX drone being gimmick waves like a spam of Revived Monsters. Do watch out for the Titan Chargers though as while he just looks like just a high health and speedy enemy. He has high golden and lazer resist, and it is recommend from now on not to put down lazer gunner or golden ranger so you can get more Juggernuts and Railgunners</p>
    <p>Now on wave 35 VX drone will come out and he super harder hard, like nightmare hard. He will kill like one railgunner maybe, but then die and kill all of your towers.</p>
    <p>So for a rough translation. </p>
    <p>You should never stuggle with VX drone unless you are on a hard map or didn't know to put down more flying detection towers for him.</p>
    <p>If you have a few fly detection tower, then he will die easily. Thankfully if you beat him you shouldn't have problems with flying enemies until the final boss of the mode, so it's a great time to work on single target dsp for the last two bosses in the mode.</p></section>
    <section> <img src="../png/destructor.png" alt="Jumper 2">
        <figcaption id="jumper"><b>Destructor</b></figcaption><p>The waves after VX drone aren't that bad, but watch out for the introduction to X Juggernut that can burn down your tower easily and having insane golden and lazer resist on top of that.</p>
    <p>To stop this just get some bottom path Juggernuts and something to heal them up as well, and other then the X Juggernuts there is a wave that spams super fast Revived Abominations with Speed Deployers, but it also the last spam heavy wave so just have good stun and splash damage and your golden for the wave 40 mini boss, <b>Destructor</b>.</p> 
    <p>Destructor is the last mini boss before the big man himself, and to be honest her not that bad. He comes out using he <b>Destruction Storm</b> making a storm cloud in the air that strikes many of your towers in a pretty big range; he also has a few lazer cannon attacks that can hit air towers along with ground, making them stunned for a bit too; and lastly he can make big jump along the map however he doesn't go too far, because of his slow speed. Also VX Drone is here in the back after a few seconds of Destructor being on the feild I guess.</p>
    <p>Now Destructor is a very slow boss, so if you been following what I've been saying you should have bottom path Railgunners to chip him down for high damage, and if you lost a few top path Railgunners for VX Drone you should put some more down to hand it. Other then that, these two our quite easy; however after the wave a lot of spaced out hidden Titan Chargers with this being last money making wave before the finale of wave 42</p></section>
    <section><img src="../png/madchild.png" alt="Very Mad Child">
        <figcaption id="erad"><b>Eradicator MK II+</b></figcaption>
        <p>Eradicator MK II+ is the upgraded version of Eradicator MK II, the original final boss of expert when Tdx first released. Expert used to be insanely hard, and known to be one of the hardest modes in any tower defense game; however overtime power creep slowly made the mode into a joke. So in lore the creator of Eradicator MK II, Dr.Xenon, had upgraded him into Eradicator MK II+, and in game you can feel it right as he enters. While other bosses have a few enemies coming out with them on the wave to help push the boss up as they sit in the back. Eradicator MK II+ comes out alone with a massive jump in health, being more then double the health of Destructor. He sets the tone of the fight as soon as he starts walking out of the entrance with his looks, music, and then his gameplay</p>
        <p>Eradicator MK II+ is a heavy weapon war machine, being very slow, but making up for that with hit more then 8 different attacks that he quickly cycles through out the battle. While you can use bate towers to bate out some of his attacks, a good few of them while only be used on maxed level towers, or the highest costing tower in range. bate is still a good idea, but a good tanky tower like Juggernut will more better for dsp and survivable. Eradicator MK II+ mostly just has attacking moves, but he has two support tools in his loadout off moves. One being his self heal, and the reason why you can't let off on dsp. His other support move is pretty annoying though, as it a flare that spawns some drones in, the front ones will push attack your towers with missiles; however there also some that spawn behind him and they will heal him up. So it very importent to have some of your fly detection tower on last to kill the healing drones before they can quickly heal up Eradicator MK II+ back to full.</p>
        <p>This will go on for a while until half health where his armor and lots of his weapons break off as he then put up a shield as his spins around firing off his massive minigun arms at your towers, before ending it off with fire out some missiles and spawning in a lot of drones. After the drones are dead, you have mostly won. He now a sitting duck without his extra weapons. So this the time to finish off, but just as a tiny warning. He can make himself hidden along with healing himself, so if you don't have money to spare after the rage drones, Mk2+ might be able to make it to the exit.</p></section></article>
